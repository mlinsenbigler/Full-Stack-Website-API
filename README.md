**Architecture

Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?**

*The front end development began with a static HTML side handled by Express. This initial phase was iterated into a more dynamic structure of MVC (model, view, controller). This structure allows for multiple views that can be presented to the user depending on the content being returned. Finally, the frontend was moved into an SPA. One of the most beneficial aspects of the SPA is that all of the site's content gets loaded on the first request from the server. This means the application does not need to reach back to the server each time the user interacts or requests an action from the site. The backend used a NoSQL MongoDB database because the entire project was constructed using M.E.A.N which includes MongoDB to allow for database services that integrates seamlessly with the other M.E.A.N. components.*


**Functionality

How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.**

*JSON is different than Javascript because its format is much easier to read. It also creates key/pair values that you call reference when writing other code modules. The JSON is easy to parse any value out of. It takes much less time to pass data using JSON than it does using XML. Because of JSON's formatting, it can be passed into various data structures quite easily. This is important when making and sending data requests between the frontend and backend components. Having both the client and server passing data via JSON ensures reliability can be maintained.*


**Testing

Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.**

The endpoints act as the API's single point of contact for communication with other components or services for a specific function. This way, all data regarding a specific function passes through one point which makes validating and securing that data easier. The methods are the instructions that that dictate how the endpoints communicate. The methods are called upon, based on specific conditions and criteria which then returns new data or instructions on what the endpoint should do next. Incorporating security on both sides of the endpoints ensures that the communication is secure and also that the data being shared is validated on each end.


**Reflection

How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?**

This course has definitely added to my confidence level regarding full stack development. Being able to handle all aspects of applications from the backend database and server to the frontend SPA client interface is a huge accomplishment and will provide more career opportunities in the future. Even if I chose to focus specifically on only one aspect of the full stack, knowing how the various components and layers interact will make me a better candidate for that specific skill area and I can market myself accordingly.
